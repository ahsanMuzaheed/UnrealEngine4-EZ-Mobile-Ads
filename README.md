# FAQ
## ★ package IOS on mac fail
  if u use remote build to package for ios, it should works fine.
  but if u launch the engine on mac and package for ios, it will fail, this is a bug of UBT on mac,
  the solution is run the command as root:
  
  ln -s /Users/Shared/Epic\ Games/ /Users/Shared/EpicGames
  

## ★ Why My admob not show?
  There's a lot of reasons why admob not show correctly,you can install the admob test apk from 
  https://github.com/feixuwu/UnrealEngine4-EZ-Mobile-Ads/blob/master/AdmobHelpApk/AdmobTest.apk
  this apk use google official test ad unit, if it works, then the admob is working and the plugin is working correct,
  you may need check your admob account or wait some time to let ad unit active(if the ad unit is new created).
  
  to show Admob rewarded video, your phone need have google service installed, some device removed all google service,then
  the rewarded video may not show correct.
  
  here is the offical test ad unit which I copy from 
  https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-android-examples
  
  you can change the admob setting to use this test ad unit to check if the plugin works on your game.
  
  Android:

## ★ how to change placement in runtime for Unity ads?

  after call SetCurrentPlacement, all the Unity ads's check and play function  will works on the new placement.

## ★ I'm not good with C++, can I use this plugin?

  Yes, of course you can, use this plugin, you don't have to have C++ knowlege, and don't need recompile the all engine. 
  
  But you need to have visualstudio or xcode can build C++ code, just put the plugins folder under you project root folder,  
  then double click the uproject file as usual, after several minutes(3-5), the editor will launch.
  
## ★ If I use in project with engine version 4.17, it will remind me the plugin is not compatible with engine, is there compatible problem?

 No, after do some debug and read 4.17 source, I found it's the engine bug, all the plugin without binary will get the warning.
 There's a engine bug report here: https://issues.unrealengine.com/issue/UE-49007
 
 So after the engine remind you if disable the plugin, click no, and then confirm to build the plugin, next time to start the project,
 the warning will dissappear.
